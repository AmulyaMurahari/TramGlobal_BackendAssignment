# TramGlobal_BackendAssignment

### Assignment Overview: This assignment is to develop a server-side logic, handle databases and ensure high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end.

### Task :
A url shortener is a service used by internet users to shorten long, hard to remember URLs into easy to share shortened re-directs.
The project
- Creates an endpoint that takes in a long URL and returns a shortened one with a random short ending.
- Creates an endpoint that returns a history of all URLs shortened by a given user.
- Make the short urls actually redirect to their long url counterparts.
- Requests should be tier based. For example a Tier 1 user can make 1000 requests
whereas Tier 2 user can make only 100 requests.

#### I've also uploaded a ReactJS front-end file that includes basic functionalities for inputting a long URL and receiving a shortened URL in return. However, the connection between this front-end and the back-end hasn't been established yet.
